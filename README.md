# Unit-Testing-with-Singleton

This project will encourage the use of interface in TypeScript Projects to implement Singleton Pattern to enhance testability of code.

## Getting Started

- Make sure Node is installed on your machine, you can test it by typing the command below in your terminal. If it doesn't show the version number of Node, please proceed to install node on your machine following instructions from [Node official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/)
```
node -v
```
- To enable TypeScript, do as below, which installs TypeScript module globally
```
npm install -g typescript
```
- You can test your installation by:
```
tsc --version
```

## Transpiling TypeScript

All the codes in thos project is written in the ```src-ts``` folder. After writing your TypeScript code in ```src-ts``` folder, you should type:
```
tsc -w
```
to **transpile** and **watch** the files in ```src-ts``` folder.

To start the project and make sure it is runnable. Open up a new terminal, then:
```
cd src-js
node .
```
Then you should see a ```Hello``` greeting for you in the console!
